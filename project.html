        And tragically, the average eater has not undergone a 
        food safety course on how to cook and consume all the 
        things without getting violently ill (or worse). For 
        animal proteins (i.e. meat), the CliffsNotes version is 
        to cook them thoroughly and to keep raw produce away from 
        raw meat, particularly chicken, which poses unique risks 
        when left out at room temperature, even when it is fully 
        cooked.
